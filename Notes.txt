I want you to act as a software developer. I will provide some specific information about a web app requirements, and it will be your job to come up with an architecture for developing an job recommendation app integrated with a machine learning. the goal of the app is users to get recommendation on jobs that suits them. the features of the app will include viewing all jobs from a database, get recommendations for suitable jobs according to his/her input data, apply for the job, view applied jobs! 
I need to use React, PostgreSQL and FastAPI as the tools and I'm using VS code. Also I need to train the ML model in google collab.


I need to develop a web app for below requirements,
1. I need to train a high accuracy machine learning model from an excel file which contains some user details and job details that recommends job vacancies posted by agencies when a customer enters his/her personal data.

2. A customer should be able to fill in the personal data in the UI(like in a form) then below their should be a button named "Get job recommendations" and when the customer fills in data and clicked this button, all the relevant job vacancies should be listed (from the job posts that are trained in the ML model).

3. Additionally their should be a "view all jobs" button, and when clicked this button i need to show the all jobs from the postgreSQL database that consist all the job posts.


(My supervisor said to use FastAPI as it will be good)

I need proper beginner level guidance with the code for all the steps (Set up the Environment, Build the FastAPI Backend, Build the Frontend).



(Name,Age,Gender,Height,Weight,Marital Status,Number of Children,Education,Skills,Interests,Previous Jobs,Looking Jobs,Description,Passport Status). 

Job ID, Job Title, Country, Job Description, Skills Required, Experience Required, Age Required, Salary, Working Hour, Facilities, Looking gender, No. of job seekers required,Available Quantity



git remote add origin https://github.com/MohomedReeza1/JobRecommendationSystem.git

https://github.com/MohomedReeza1/JobRecommendationSystem



now i need to Save the model, Test the model on test data,




Step 1: Setting Up Your Data
1. Structure Your Data
2. Clean Your Data
3. Data Splitting

Step 2: Training the Model
1. Define Inputs and Outputs
2. Configure Model Settings
3. Train the Model

Step 3: Testing and Evaluating the Model
1. Apply the Model to Testing Data
2. Evaluate Accuracy

Step 4: Making Predictions with New Data
1. Enter New Data
2. Generate Predictions

are these the steps of creating a machine learning model

APPLY JOBS - QUESTIONS

I need to show the apply_job page so that if a user clicks "apply now" from "Jobs" page, i need to have a form to enter user details in the applying page (Name,Age,Gender,Height,Weight,Marital Status,Number of Children,Education,Skills,Interests,Previous Jobs,Looking Jobs,Description,Passport Status) and click confirm apply. (I need to save this user data into the database as well)

And if a user clicks "apply now" from the recommended jobs "Recommendation" page (after getting recommendations), no need to have a form to enter user details again (as the user already entered the details in the form and got recommendations), just click confirm apply.

A user can apply for one or more jobs as he/she browse through my web-app. And i need to store these applied jobs in the database (applied_jobs table) and show all these applied jobs in the "/applied-jobs" page for the user.

Are there any issues related to this requirement (do we need to implement a session for this? or do we need to implement signup/login or login as a guest or anything like this) or we can implement this requirement?

✅ Job Saved/Shortlisted (Specify percentage): No need for Saved/Shortlisted jobs.
✅ Job Ignored (Specify percentage): This is possible. Not every person looking for every job. A person is mostly looking for the relevant jobs based on his/her skills/interests.
Interaction Value Ranges: Application rate: 5%, Click rate: 15%, View rate: 30%, , ignore rate: 50%)

5. Special Considerations
Do you need additional features (e.g., language skills, agency preferences)? No
Do you want some missing/incomplete data for realism? (e.g., 5% missing values) Yes
Do you need data biases to reflect real-world trends? (e.g., certain jobs preferred by males/females) Yes, Also analyze that some jobs are mostly for females (like House Maid, House Nurse, Nurse, Baby Sitter). and some jobs are mostly for males (like Driver,House Driver, House Boy, Warehouse Asssistants, Supervisor, Head Waiter). And also there are some jobs that are required both males and females (like Waiter, Housekeeper, Cleaner, Worker, House Keeper). Therefore distribution these suitably.


For your reference to take an idea from a real dataset that consisting these 109 job titles -> what gender each job title have,which country this job is mostly having and which jobs have the most demands i will attach an excel file.

Please carefully create me this dataset with the information provided and using the job_list excel that contains a real dataset of jobs.


I need the carefully prepared output in one excel file with three sheets.


user_data – 300–500 users with diverse profiles.
job_data – 100+ job listings enriched with relevant skills, descriptions, and required qualifications.
interaction_data – 2,000–5,000 interactions (views, clicks, applications, and ignores) following your specified distribution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Skills Relevance:

Should the skills for each job be researched based on industry standards, or do you have a specific reference or job descriptions you’d like me to use? I don't have any references for job descriptions or skills. researched based on industry standard will be best.
Should the skills be formatted as a comma-separated string? yes.

2. Salary Currency & Conversion:

You mentioned salaries in "Rs." – should this be in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) or another currency? yes, this is in Sri Lankan Rupees.
If using Sri Lankan Rupees, should I convert from the typical salaries paid in these countries? No need, Just use random salary distribution between 150000 to 300000.

3. Age & Experience Distribution:

Should I use a uniform random distribution for age and experience, or do you want some jobs (e.g., skilled roles) to lean towards experienced workers while others (e.g., helpers) allow first-time applicants? skilled roles to lean towards experienced workers while others allow first-time applicants will be better.

4. Gender Distribution:

I will follow the gender preferences you outlined, but should I ensure a strict adherence (e.g., no male Housemaids) or allow minor variance? yes jobs like House Maid, House Nurse, Baby Sitter are only for females and hard jobs like House Boy, Technicians, Machine Operators, Industrial jobs are only for males. Jobs like Waiter, Housekeeper, Cleaner, Worker, House Keeper, general helper are common for both male and females. Therefore distribution these suitably.

5. Country & Job Frequency:

Should high-frequency countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Dubai, Romania) have more jobs than others, or should each country have an equal number? yes, these countries have more jobs.

6. Dataset Format:

Do you need this in Excel (.xlsx) format, CSV (.csv), or both?
Do you require a SQL script to insert this data into a database?

for now i need .xlsx format in order to train the ML model, later i need this to import into PostgreSQL

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want you to conduct industry-specific research for these job titles and insert suitable job related skills

Job Seeker Dataset creation

I need you to create a dataset about 700–900 users with diverse profiles enriched with relevant Skills(critical), Interests(critical), Previous Jobs(critical), Looking Jobs(critical) and Description(critical) for the following columns. 

User ID, Name, Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Marital Status, Number of Children, Education, Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs, Description, Passport Status

1. User ID - This should contain primary numbers starting from 1.

2. Name - Sri Lankan names (example: Nimal Jayawardena-Male, Manisha Gamage-female)

14. Description - empty for now

15. Passport Status - 70% Valid, 20% Applied, 10% Invalid


Special Considerations
Do you want some missing/incomplete data for realism? (e.g., 5% missing values) Yes

Do you need data biases to reflect real-world trends? (e.g., certain jobs preferred by males/females) Yes

To ensure the format is okay i want you to only create 30 rows of data. If everythings okay we will continue to generate Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs, Description columns.

example row:

user_data – 700–900 users with diverse profiles.
job_data – 200 job listings enriched with relevant skills, descriptions, and required qualifications.
interaction_data – 5,000–10,000 interactions (views, clicks, applications, and ignores) following your specified distribution.

Template description-

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//So for these critical columns i will provide some data in order to help you generating these data. 

Find the updated job_list-interest-skills.xlsx file.
job_seeker_sample_unique.xlsx this is the file you need to fill in Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs columns.

job_list-interest-skills.xlsx this file contains a 100 different job titles, skills related to each job titles and interests related to each job titles and also a dataset of 200 different job posts with job details such as Job Description, Skills Required, Experience Required, Looking gender. This will make you life easier to generate for like 700-900 data.

10. Skills - So skills must contain minimum of 2 skills related to either a user's Previous Job or Looking Job or both Previous Job and Looking Job.

11. Interests - Interests must contain minimum of 2 interests related to either a user's Previous Job or Looking Job or both Previous Job and Looking Job.

12. Previous Jobs - A user may or may not have a previous job. A user may have a multiple previous jobs. If this column has a job title, then skills and interests related to this job should be updated in the skills column and interests column.

13. Looking Jobs - A user may or may not have a looking Job. A user may have a multiple looking jobs. If this column has a job title, then skills and interests related to this job should be updated in the skills column and interests column.

14. Description - empty for now

Special conditions - 
1. A Looking Job should be based on the previous job. That means a user having experience on some job will looking for the same job. A user can have both multiple previous jobs and looking jobs. Also a user may not have both a previous job or a looking job (In this case, still a user can have interests and skills)
2. The gender of the user should be dependent with the jobs that they are eligible. "job_list" sheet of job_list-interest-skills.xlsx contains the looking gender for every job posts (male or female or male, female both).
3. If two jobs in the same job category have common Skills & interests, then previous jobs or/and looking jobs can contain those two jobs (for example, "Health Assessment" skill is common for both Nurse and House Nurse, so where the skill is Health Assessment their previous jobs or/and looking jobs can be Nurse or House Nurse). But an unrelated jobs cannot contain be together.
4. It is okay to have unmatching looking jobs for a very few data. But later in a "interaction dataset" we need to show that we ignored (or didn't show interest) these jobs.

Your concerns - 
1. Skills & Interests
Should Skills be occupation-related (e.g., "Carpentry, Plumbing") or include general skills (e.g., "Teamwork, Problem-solving")? I have given a list of skills and interests for each job title.

Should Interests be more personal (e.g., "Sports, Traveling") or career-related (e.g., "Learning new machinery, Customer service")? I have given a list of skills and interests for each job title. Use those skills and interests.

2. Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs
Should Previous Jobs be more aligned with Looking Jobs or do we allow career shifts?Previous Jobs be more aligned with Looking Jobs will be more promising for creating a high accuracy ML model.

Should we mix low-skilled, semi-skilled, and skilled jobs for variety? (e.g., waiter, driver, electrician, security guard) No

Should we assign realistic job transitions (e.g., "Helper → House Boy → Driver") or keep them randomized? Yes. realistic job transitions will be promising for better results. Domestic jobs like House Cook, House Boy, House Driver, House Maid, House Nurse are also likely related. But watch out for gender restriction. 

3. Description
Should this be a short bio (e.g., "Experienced waiter looking for opportunities in a hotel.") or a detailed profile (e.g., "Worked as a waiter for 3 years, skilled in customer service and table management. Looking for jobs in hotels or restaurants.")? Keep this empty for now.

Should we add some missing or incomplete descriptions for realism? yes total 1% from the whole dataset.

Carefully generate me these columns for the generated 30 data for now according to these requirements, if this becomes successful we can move on the filling the Description.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Gender Restrictions

If a Male user has a Looking Job that is gender-restricted to Female (and vice versa), should I:
Exclude such cases entirely? 
Adjust the Looking Job based on the allowed gender from the dataset?

you are the one who is generating the Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs columns. So for a male user only include an allowed job from the job dataset. or Adjust the Looking Job based on the allowed gender from the dataset.


2. Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs Distribution

What should be the approximate distribution for:
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs?
Users with only Previous Jobs?
Users with only Looking Jobs?
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests)?

This has many possibilities such as, 
1. Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs - 
- this can contain 1 Previous Jobs, 2 Looking Jobs 
- this can contain 2 Previous Jobs, 1 Looking Jobs 
- this can contain 2 Previous Jobs, 2 Looking Jobs or many other different way right.
2. Users with only Previous Jobs?
- this can contain 1 Previous Jobs
- this can contain 2 Previous Jobs
3. Users with only Looking Jobs?
- this can contain 1 Looking Jobs
- this can contain 2 Looking Jobs
So basically this have to be in a random order and basically i can say is (including above patterns),
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs? 30% (looking jobs need to be more connected with previous job)
Users with only Previous Jobs? 19%
Users with only Looking Jobs? 20%
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests)? 1%
Users with a Looking Job same as Previous Job? 30%

before proceeding, if you have further questions do ask me

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above generated excel 5 of the data is wrong which is male job seekers have female job details (Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs). And below some requirements are changed. According to these i need to modify job_seeker_sample_unique.xlsx the Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs columns properly.

Find the updated job_list-interest-skills.xlsx file.
job_seeker_sample_unique.xlsx this is the file you need to fill in Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs columns.

12. Previous Jobs - A user may or may not have a previous job. A user may have a multiple previous jobs. If this column has a job title, then skills and interests related to this job should be updated in the skills column and interests column.

13. Looking Jobs - A user may or may not have a looking Job. A user may have a multiple looking jobs. If this column has a job title, then skills and interests related to this job should be updated in the skills column and interests column.

5. Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs Distribution

What should be the approximate distribution for:
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs?
Users with only Previous Jobs?
Users with only Looking Jobs?
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests)?

This has many possibilities such as,

2. Users with only Previous Jobs?
- this can contain 1 Previous Jobs
- this can contain 2 Previous Jobs
3. Users with only Looking Jobs?
- this can contain 1 Looking Jobs
- this can contain 2 Looking Jobs
So basically this have to be in a random order and basically i can say is (including above patterns),
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs? 15% (looking jobs need to be more connected with previous job)
Users with only Previous Jobs? 15%
Users with only Looking Jobs? 15%
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests)? 1%
Users with a Looking Job same as Previous Job? 53%
Users with unmatching previous job and looking jobs? 1%

Carefully generate me these columns for the generated 30 data for now according to these requirements, if this becomes successful we can move on the filling the Description.

before proceeding, if you have further questions do ask me

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Gender Dependency on Looking Jobs:

If a job has a gender restriction (e.g., "House Maid" is for females), should I exclude it entirely for a male seeker or replace it with a similar, gender-appropriate job (e.g., "House Boy")? You exclude it entirely for a male seeker and replace with a suitable female job seeker.

2. Mixing of Previous and Looking Jobs:

Should I strictly follow job category links (e.g., "Helper → House Boy → House Driver")? No
Or should I allow slight career shifts within related fields (e.g., "Construction Helper → Mason")? It's fine.

3. Interest & Skills Mapping:

Should I allow some overlap in skills and interests (e.g., "House Driver" and "Driver" share "Vehicle Maintenance")? Yes, its fine
Or should each record have distinct, non-overlapping entries? No

4. Skills Randomization:

Should I shuffle the order of skills & interests for variety? Yeah, i think it is okay
Or keep them consistent based on job roles?

5. Distribution Verification:

Does this final distribution align with your needs?
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs: 30%
Users with only Previous Jobs: 19%
Users with only Looking Jobs: 20%
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests): 1%
Users with a Looking Job same as Previous Job: 30%

Yes.

before proceeding, if you have further questions do ask me


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

male job seekers should not have jobs that are gender-restricted to females (and vice versa).

In this result Flower Decorator (Flower Shops), Waitress jobs are for females but two males seekers contain these jobs. What it is happening like that? Is this a mistake from you?
I cannot generate 700-900 data like this. Because the accuracy will reduce.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-For 1 previous job
Worked as a [Previous Jobs] for [between 1-5] years, skilled in [skill1] and [skill2]. Looking for jobs in hotels or restaurants.


Worked as a waiter for 3 years, skilled in customer service and table management. Looking for jobs in hotels or restaurants.

Worked as a House Driver, Commis Chef, skilled in Vehicle Maintenance, Private Transport and have a keen interest in Vehicle Maintenance, Cooking Assistance. Currently, looking for opportunities as House Driver, Commis Chef.

Lalith Bandara has experience working as House Driver, Commis Chef. They are skilled in Vehicle Maintenance, Private Transport. They have a keen interest in Vehicle Maintenance, Cooking Assistance. Currently, they are looking for opportunities as House Driver, Commis Chef.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Total Expected Row Count:
Should we aim for 700-900 additional rows on top of the 90 rows already generated? Yes
Or should the final dataset total be between 700-900 rows including existing 90?

2. Name Generation Strategy:
Since we don’t have 700+ unique Sri Lankan names, I'll use a large set of common Sri Lankan names and randomly shuffle & reuse them across different records.
Do you want a higher mix of male vs female names (e.g., 60% male, 40% female) or should I make it an even distribution? use higher mix of male vs female names.

3. Job Assignment Logic:
Right now, I am following the probability-based job assignment:
15% have both previous and looking jobs
15% have only previous jobs
15% have only looking jobs
1% have neither, but still have skills & interests
54% have looking jobs same as previous jobs
Should this distribution remain the same or do you want a different pattern for the larger dataset?

if u can use the following values,
25% have both previous and looking jobs
15% have only previous jobs
15% have only looking jobs
1% have neither, but still have skills & interests
44% have looking jobs same as previous jobs

4. Education and Passport Distribution:
The education and passport status distribution currently follows real-world probability (e.g., majority with O/L, A/L education, and 70% with valid passports). Do you want any adjustments to this distribution? No this is fine.

5. Output Format:
Would you like the final dataset split into multiple smaller files (e.g., 2-3 files for easier handling), or one single large file containing 700-900 rows? Anything is fine, i need in an excel format.


before proceeding, if you have further questions do ask me

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERACTION DATASET CREATION

How should I handle missing Previous Jobs and Looking Jobs? 
Should I assume these users explore various jobs randomly?

Well, These are the percentage of dataset contains in the combination of skills, interests and Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs in user_data.
25% have both previous and looking jobs
15% have only previous jobs
15% have only looking jobs
1% have neither, but still have skills & interests (can view, click, apply based on the skills & interests)
44% have looking jobs same as previous jobs

So for each job title there are 2 jobs in the job_data. I want you include all jobs that are related for a user in the interaction data (related in the sense can include in skills and/or interests and/or Previous Jobs and/or Looking Jobs). 

From all jobs that the users are including,
1. view must include the least related job or jobs for the user (user is viewing the job)
2. click must include the medium/average related job or jobs for the user (user is clicking the job)
3. apply must include the most related / most suitable job or jobs for the user (user is applying for the job)

With 900+ users with diverse profiles (user_data) and 200 job listings enriched with relevant skills, descriptions, and required qualifications (job_data) approximately how many interaction_data needed for the Hybrid Recommender System? and approximately how many interaction_data you can create?

interaction_data – 5,000–10,000 interactions (views, clicks, applications) following your specified distribution.

11. Handling Cold Start Problem – Provide recommendations for new users/jobs


🔹 Handling Cold Start Problem: Provide Recommendations for New Users/Jobs
The cold start problem occurs when:

1. New users join the platform without prior interactions.
2. New jobs are added that haven't received any applications.
We need a fallback recommendation strategy for both cases.

🔹 Solution: Cold Start Handling
We will use two fallback approaches:

1. For New Users:
• Recommend popular jobs (jobs with the most applications).
• Recommend jobs matching the user’s skills & interests.

2. For New Jobs:
• Recommend new jobs to users who match the job's required skills.

✅ Step 1: Get Most Popular Jobs
We determine job popularity based on the number of interactions.

def get_popular_jobs(interaction_data, top_n=5):
    """Returns the most popular jobs based on the number of applications."""
    job_popularity = interaction_data['Job ID'].value_counts().head(top_n).index.tolist()
    return job_popularity


✅ Step 2: Recommend Jobs Based on User Profile
For a new user, we check their skills & interests and recommend jobs accordingly.

def recommend_jobs_for_new_user(user_profile, job_data, top_n=5):
    """Recommends jobs based on a new user's skills & interests using TF-IDF similarity."""
    user_vector = tfidf.transform([user_profile])
    job_vectors = tfidf.transform(job_data['Details'])

    # Compute similarity
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(user_vector, job_vectors).flatten()

    # Get top-N job indices
    top_jobs_indices = similarity_scores.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
    recommended_jobs = job_data.iloc[top_jobs_indices]['Job ID'].tolist()

    return recommended_jobs

✅ Step 3: Recommend New Jobs to Matching Users
If a job is new, find users who have similar skills to the job's required skills.

def recommend_new_jobs_to_users(new_jobs, user_data, job_data, top_n=5):
    """Finds the best users for newly added jobs based on skills match."""
    recommendations = {}

    for _, job in new_jobs.iterrows():
        job_vector = tfidf.transform([job['Details']])
        user_vectors = tfidf.transform(user_data['Profile'])

        # Compute similarity between job and users
        similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(job_vector, user_vectors).flatten()

        # Get top-N user indices
        top_users_indices = similarity_scores.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
        recommended_users = user_data.iloc[top_users_indices]['User ID'].tolist()

        recommendations[job['Job ID']] = recommended_users

    return recommendations

✅ Step 4: Integrate Cold Start Recommendations
We check if a user is new or if a job is new, and apply the appropriate fallback.

def get_cold_start_recommendations(user_id, user_data, job_data, interaction_data):
    """Handles cold start by providing fallback recommendations for new users or jobs."""
    
    # If the user is new (no prior interactions)
    if user_id not in interaction_data['User ID'].unique():
        print(f"User {user_id} is new. Providing cold-start recommendations.")
        user_profile = user_data[user_data['User ID'] == user_id]['Profile'].values[0]
        
        # Recommend jobs based on user profile
        return recommend_jobs_for_new_user(user_profile, job_data)
    
    return None  # No cold start needed for existing users

✅ Step 5: Handle Cold Start for Jobs
If new jobs exist, assign them to users who match their skillset.

def get_cold_start_jobs(job_data, interaction_data):
    """Finds jobs that have not received any applications (cold start jobs)."""
    new_jobs = job_data[~job_data['Job ID'].isin(interaction_data['Job ID'].unique())]
    if not new_jobs.empty:
        print("New jobs detected. Finding best users for them.")
        return recommend_new_jobs_to_users(new_jobs, user_data, job_data)
    
    return None  # No cold start jobs found


🔹 Final Step: Apply Cold Start Strategy
Integrate these functions when generating recommendations.

# Example Usage:

user_id = 999  # Example new user ID
cold_start_recommendations = get_cold_start_recommendations(user_id, user_data, job_data, interaction_data)

if cold_start_recommendations:
    print(f"Cold Start Recommendations for User {user_id}: {cold_start_recommendations}")
else:
    print(f"User {user_id} has interactions, using normal recommendation system.")

cold_start_jobs = get_cold_start_jobs(job_data, interaction_data)

if cold_start_jobs:
    print("Cold Start Job Assignments:", cold_start_jobs)


🔹 Summary
✅ Cold Start for New Users:

If a user has no prior interactions, recommend popular jobs or jobs matching their profile.
✅ Cold Start for New Jobs:

If a job has no applications, recommend it to users with matching skills.

I need you to explain this Three-tier architecture (Presentation Tier, Application Tier, Data Tier) in well explained, detail oriented paragraphs.



======================================================================================
CHAPTER 3: Design
3.1 Chapter Overview
The design phase plays a crucial role in the development of the Job Recommendation Platform, ensuring that all system components are structured efficiently to meet performance, usability, and scalability requirements. This chapter details the architectural design, system workflow, algorithmic implementation, UI/UX considerations, and data flow. The design decisions align with the three-tier architecture approach, ensuring a modular and scalable implementation.
3.2 Design Goals
The design of the system is guided by the following objectives.
Design Goal	Description
Scalability	The platform should efficiently handle an increasing number of users and job postings.
Usability	The UI should be intuitive, ensuring ease of use for job seekers and recruitment agencies.
Efficiency	The recommendation algorithms should provide accurate and fast job suggestions.
Modularity	The system should be developed with a three-tier architecture to allow independent modification of components.
Security	User data must be protected through secure authentication and data encryption.
Integration	The system should support seamless interaction between the frontend, backend, and database.

3.3 System Architecture Design
The system follows a three-tier architecture, consisting of the presentation tier, application tier and data tier. Below is a high-level architectural representation:
(A system architecture diagram will be included here.)


3.3.1 Presentation Tier
The Presentation Layer serves as the user-facing component of the Job Recommendation Platform, developed using React.js. This layer is responsible for displaying job listings, personalized recommendations, and tracking application statuses. It facilitates seamless interaction between users and the system by offering an intuitive and responsive interface. Additionally, the frontend manages user authentication and profile management, ensuring secure access to user-specific functionalities. Communication with the backend occurs through RESTful APIs, allowing real-time data retrieval and interaction, thereby enhancing user experience and system efficiency.
3.3.2 Application Tier
The Application Layer, built using FastAPI, is the core processing unit of the platform. It manages user authentication, job searches, and recommendation logic, ensuring smooth interaction between users and the system. This layer processes job seeker profiles, applies machine learning algorithms to generate personalized job recommendations, and retrieves job listings based on user preferences. Additionally, the backend enforces security mechanisms, including JWT authentication for secure login and CORS middleware for cross-origin request handling, thereby maintaining data integrity and user privacy.
3.3.3 Data Tier
The Data Layer serves as the storage and retrieval engine of the platform, utilizing PostgreSQL as the database management system. It is responsible for maintaining structured records, including user profiles, job listings, application statuses, and user-job interactions. The database is optimized for fast retrieval of job recommendations, ensuring that queries are executed efficiently without compromising performance. Additionally, it maintains referential integrity and indexing, allowing for structured data management and consistent updates while preventing data redundancy or corruption.
3.4 Detailed Design
(Diagrams such as class, sequence, or flow diagrams will be included here.)

The chosen design paradigm for this project is Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD). OOAD is a methodology that ensures the system is structured around objects, encapsulating both data and behavior. The platform follows an object-oriented approach where components such as job seekers, job listings, and applications are represented as distinct objects with defined attributes and methods. Using OOAD enables modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance, as each component can be updated or modified independently without affecting the entire system. The interaction between these objects is facilitated by well-defined interfaces, allowing seamless integration of different system modules, including the frontend, backend, and database.
3.4.1 Frontend Components
The frontend comprises multiple key sections that allow users to navigate and interact with the platform effectively. The Homepage serves as the initial entry point, displaying a welcome message and guiding users through the platform's navigation. The Job Listings Page provides an organized list of available job opportunities, enabling users to browse and filter through postings relevant to their preferences. The Recommendations Page presents personalized job suggestions, leveraging machine learning algorithms to match users with suitable job roles. The Apply Job Page facilitates job applications by allowing job seekers to submit their details for specific positions. Lastly, the Profile Page provides users with the ability to manage and update their personal information, ensuring that their skills, experience, and job preferences remain current.
3.4.2 Backend Components
The backend, built using FastAPI, is responsible for handling all core functionalities and processing logic. FastAPI enables rapid API development and seamless communication between different system components. The Job Management Module retrieves and maintains job listings, allowing recruiters to post vacancies and seekers to view them. The Recommendation Engine, powered by machine learning algorithms, processes user data to generate highly relevant job recommendations. FastAPI is also responsible for handling API requests, managing the integration between the frontend and database, and ensuring optimized data exchange. The Application Processing Module tracks job applications, records application statuses, and provides job seekers with real-time updates. By utilizing FastAPI’s asynchronous processing capabilities, the backend ensures high performance and scalability.
3.4.3 Machine Learning Component
The machine learning component is deeply integrated into the recommendation engine to improve job-matching accuracy. The system employs content-based filtering using TF-IDF vectorization, where job descriptions and user profiles are converted into feature vectors, and collaborative filtering through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which analyzes job seeker interaction data to predict potential job preferences. These models are trained using job seeker profiles, historical application data, and job descriptions. FastAPI acts as the intermediary between the frontend and machine learning models, handling data preprocessing and model execution. When a job seeker requests recommendations, FastAPI processes the request, retrieves relevant data, and generates job suggestions in real-time by invoking the machine learning models. This architecture ensures a seamless flow of information, improving the accuracy and relevance of job recommendations.
3.4.4 Database Schema
The database serves as the backbone of the system, storing and managing critical data. The Users Table stores details such as seeker_id, name, age, skills, previous jobs, looking jobs, and passport status, capturing the full profile of job seekers. The Jobs Table holds job related information, including job_id, job_title, country, required_skills and experience_required, ensuring comprehensive job descriptions. The Applications Table records all job applications, associating application_id with the respective seeker_id and job_id, along with application statuses. Lastly, the User-Job Interactions Table logs interaction details such as interaction_id, seeker_id, job_id, interaction_type, and interaction_value, enabling efficient tracking of user engagement with job postings.
3.5 Algorithm Design
The system utilizes three primary recommendation algorithms, including a hybrid model that integrates both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches:
3.5.1 Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF Vectorization)
Content-based filtering is a recommendation technique that evaluates the textual similarities between job descriptions and job seeker profiles. This approach leverages TF-IDF vectorization (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which converts textual data into numerical values based on word importance. The TF-IDF method assigns higher weights to words that appear frequently in a document but less frequently across the entire dataset, ensuring that only the most relevant terms contribute to the recommendation process.
The system first extracts key terms from job descriptions and user profiles, converting them into TF-IDF feature vectors. Once vectorization is complete, the cosine similarity metric is used to measure the similarity between the job seeker’s profile and each job description. Jobs with higher similarity scores are ranked higher and presented as recommendations.
3.5.1.1 Pseudocode for Content-Based Filtering
Input: Job Seeker Profile, Job Listings Database
1. Convert job seeker profile into a TF-IDF vector
2. Convert all job descriptions into TF-IDF vectors
3. Compute cosine similarity between seeker vector and job vectors
4. Rank jobs based on similarity score
5. Return top N recommended jobs
This approach ensures that job seekers receive recommendations that closely match their skills and interests, even if they are new to the platform and have not interacted with job postings before.
3.5.2 Collaborative Filtering (Singular Value Decomposition - SVD)
Collaborative filtering is a recommendation approach that predicts user preferences based on past interactions. Unlike content-based filtering, which relies on job descriptions, collaborative filtering uses historical data to identify job seekers with similar behavior patterns. The system builds a user-job interaction matrix, where rows represent job seekers, columns represent job postings, and values indicate past interactions (such as job applications or saved jobs).
Since this matrix is often sparse, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied to reduce dimensionality and reveal latent features that describe the relationship between users and jobs. SVD decomposes the matrix into three smaller matrices, capturing patterns in user-job interactions. Using these latent factors, the system can predict missing values in the matrix, estimating a job seeker's preference for jobs they have not interacted with before.
This method enhances the recommendation system by identifying jobs that similar users have applied for, making it particularly effective for job seekers who have a history of job searches and applications.
3.5.2.1 Pseudocode for Collaborative Filtering (SVD)
Input: User-Job Interaction Matrix
1. Apply matrix factorization using SVD
2. Decompose matrix into user and job latent features
3. Predict missing job interactions for each user
4. Rank jobs based on predicted interaction scores
5. Return top N recommended jobs
This approach continuously improves as more users interact with the platform, refining job recommendations over time based on evolving job-seeker preferences and industry trends.

3.5.3 Hybrid Recommendation Model
The Hybrid Recommendation Model combines the strengths of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to deliver more accurate and personalized job recommendations. By integrating these two approaches, the system ensures that job seekers receive relevant job suggestions.
How the Hybrid Model Works,
1.	Content-based filtering is used to find jobs that match the user’s profile based on TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
2.	Collaborative filtering (SVD) analyzes historical interactions of similar users to predict the most relevant jobs.
3.	The system weights both approaches and combines the results to improve recommendation quality.
4.	If a user has no prior interactions, the model relies more on content-based filtering.
5.	If a user has sufficient interaction history, the collaborative filtering component plays a larger role.
3.5.3.1 Pseudocode for Hybrid Model:
Input: Job Seeker Profile, Job Listings Database, User-Job Interaction Data
1. Compute TF-IDF similarity scores between seeker profile and job descriptions
2. Compute SVD-based predictions for job interactions
3. Combine both scores using a weighted approach
4. Rank jobs based on combined similarity and preference scores
5. Return top N recommended jobs
This hybrid approach ensures that recommendations remain accurate, diverse, and adaptive to user behavior, making it more effective for both new and returning job seekers.
Flowchart for Recommendation Process
(A flowchart illustrating the recommendation algorithm will be included here.)
3.6 UI Design
The UI focuses on simplicity and accessibility by providing an easy-to-navigate and intuitive interface. It is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal functionality across both mobile and desktop devices. To enhance usability, the system will incorporate features such as search filters and category-based job browsing, allowing users to efficiently find job opportunities that match their profiles once implemented.
The user interface is attached in the Appendix A
3.7 System Process Workflow
The system workflow begins when a user logs in or registers on the platform. Once authenticated, their profile information is processed to match them with suitable job opportunities. The system retrieves relevant job listings from the database and feeds them into the recommendation engine, which generates personalized job matches based on the user’s profile and past interactions. When a user decides to apply for a job, the system records their application and updates its status accordingly. Job agencies then review these applications, assess candidates, and update the status of job postings. Finally, users receive updates on their application progress, ensuring they stay informed about their job search outcomes.

1. Model Performance Metrics

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for classification tasks.
RMSE, MAE, or MAPE if applicable to regression-based predictions.
Comparison against baseline models.

As you know already about my excel dataset. According to the model Evaluate Performance – Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG, RMSE and MRR as below.
MRR: 0.8174
Precision@5: 0.2585
Recall@5: 0.9851
NDCG: 0.8564
RMSE: 0.0270

2. Dataset Testing

How was the dataset split (train/test ratio)? 
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(interaction_data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Did you use any benchmark datasets or only collected data? i only used collected data, with dataset created with the help of recruitment agency representatives.
Any challenges faced with data preprocessing? Not much, below is my data preprocessing part,
# Step 2: Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, combine attributes
user_data.fillna('', inplace=True)
job_data.fillna('', inplace=True)
interaction_data.fillna(0, inplace=True)

user_data['Profile'] = (
    user_data['Skills'] + ' ' +
    user_data['Interests'] + ' ' +
    user_data['Previous Jobs'] + ' ' +
    user_data['Looking Jobs'] + ' ' +
    user_data['Description']
)

job_data['Details'] = (
    job_data['Job Title'] + ' ' +
    job_data['Skills Required'] + ' ' +
    job_data['Experience Required'] + ' ' +
    job_data['Job Description']
)

3. Robustness and Edge Case Handling - Will write this step later.

How did the model perform when tested with missing or noisy input data?
Were any adversarial test cases introduced?

4. Testing Results Interpretation

Any observed biases or patterns in job recommendations? Yes, as tfidf-vectorizer (content-based filtering) shows promising results, sometimes the collabarative filtering (SVD) shows some bias to some jobs according to the user-job interaction data provided for training the model.
Did the recommendations align well with user expectations? majority of the job recommendations align well with user expectations.
Key areas identified for future improvements. 
1. Need to improve collabarative filtering (SVD) algorithm in order to recommend jobs correctly with past user interaction data. 
2. Currently gender restricted job recommendation is not implemented. Need to train the model based on the gender. (so that male only jobs not showing to females and vice versa). 
3. Likewise considering other parameters to train the model with (age, Experience details, education)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need you to modify 5.3 functional testing by including how/what we have tested inside each of Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing based on my project

I need you to modify 5.4 Non-Functional Testing by including how/what we have tested inside each of Performance Testing, Scalability Testing, Usability Testing, Reliability Testing based on my project. Make sure number them properly as subtopics


I need to state that 5.4.1 Performance Testing, 5.4.2 Scalability Testing and 5.4.3 Usability Testing these three sections haven't done testing yet until the model and frontend to be finalized. And also including what i will do in future for these 3 sections(do not rewrite the whole report, edit only this part)

I need to modify the existing code or/and implement new code based on my existing developed system in order to achieve the goal of implementation of User Authentication and 
Multi-User Role Support (Job Seekers & Recruiters); (Job Search & Filtering System, Enhancing Job Recommendations, Application Tracking & Status Updates, Messaging & Notifications, UI/UX Enhancements, Deployment & Performance Optimization - in future implementation)

before going to codes; what needs to modify in order to achieve the above goal? what needs to newly create? what are problems need to face in order to achieve the goal according to the way we have implemented so far (if any)?

Brief explanation: 
🔧 Need to expand the current system as separate logins for job seekers and recruitment agencies:
1. If a job seeker is registered/logged in they should be able to create a profile with (Name,Age,Gender,Height,Weight,Marital Status,Number of Children,Education,Skills,Interests,Previous Jobs,Looking Jobs,Description,Passport Status) and view all jobs, get recommendations, apply for jobs.

2. Recruitment agency should be registered/logged in they should be able to create an agency profile with (name, license number and other suitable fields). (Here in future I may need a separate feature to verify the agency if this a legit agency by using the license number) and add jobs (with Job ID, Job Title, Country, Job Description, Skills Required, Experience Required, Age Required, Salary, Working Hour, Facilities, Looking gender, No. of job seekers required, Available Quantity as the fields), view all jobs and view users who have applied for their jobs.

🔧 need to store job seekers profile data, job seekers applied jobs data, recruitment agency profile data, recruitment agency posts data, data of the users who have applied for each recruitment agency in Database.

Suggest me a proper way to implement these requirements and maybe suggest an implementation roadmap?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📅 Suggested Implementation Roadmap
📌 Phase 1: Authentication & Multi-User Role Setup
✅ Modify Database (users, job_seekers, recruitment_agencies).
✅ Implement JWT Authentication (Login/Register).
✅ Restrict API Access Based on User Role.

📌 Phase 2: Job Seeker Features
✅ Allow Job Seekers to Create Profiles.
✅ Enable Viewing & Applying to Jobs.
✅ Fetch Job Recommendations for Logged-in Users.

📌 Phase 3: Recruitment Agency Features
✅ Allow Recruiters to Create Agency Profiles.
✅ Enable Recruiters to Post & Manage Jobs.
✅ Enable Recruiters to View Applicants for Their Jobs.

📌 Phase 4: UI & UX Enhancements
✅ Create Separate Dashboards for Job Seekers & Recruiters.
✅ Improve Navigation & Display of Jobs & Applications.
✅ Ensure Profile & Job Posting Pages Are Responsive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📅 Phase-Wise Implementation Roadmap NEW


📌 Phase 1: Authentication & Multi-User Role Setup

✅ Modify Database (models.py)
Add a User table for authentication with role (job_seeker or recruiter).
Ensure each email is unique to prevent role conflicts.

✅ Implement JWT Authentication (auth.py)
Register & login functionality for job seekers & recruiters separately.

✅ Restrict API Access Based on User Role
Job Seekers → Can view jobs, apply for jobs, get recommendations.
Recruiters → Can post & manage job listings, view applicants.
🚨 Recruiters trying to apply for a job receive an error message guiding them to create a job seeker account.


📌 Phase 2: Job Seeker Features

✅ Allow Job Seekers to Create Profiles (job_seeker_profile.py)
Fields: Name, Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Skills, Interests, Passport Status, etc.

✅ Enable Viewing & Applying to Jobs (jobs.py)
API: /jobs/ to view job listings
API: /apply-job/ to apply for a job
🚨 If a recruiter tries to apply, return: "You are signed in as a recruiter. Please create a job seeker account to apply."

✅ Fetch Job Recommendations for Logged-in Users (recommendations.py)
Recommend jobs based on job seeker profile & interactions



📌 Phase 3: Recruitment Agency Features

✅ Allow Recruiters to Create Agency Profiles (recruiters.py)
Fields: First Name, Last Name, Company Name, License Number, Work Email

✅ Enable Recruiters to Post & Manage Jobs (jobs.py)
API: /post-job/ allows only recruiters to create jobs
API: /my-posted-jobs/ shows jobs posted by a recruiter

✅ Enable Recruiters to View Applicants for Their Jobs (applications.py)
API: /job-applicants/{job_id}/ lists who applied for a recruiter’s job


📌 Phase 4: Frontend UI & Role-Based Routing

✅ Modify Navigation
Homepage Header:
"Login / Sign Up" (for job seekers only)
"For Employers" (leads to employer signup page)
Employer Signup Page (/employer-signup/)
Includes Company Name, License Number, Work Email, Create Account
Separate Login Pages
Job Seekers Login (/login)
Recruiters Login (/employer-login)

✅ Separate Dashboards
Job Seekers Dashboard (/dashboard-seeker)
View jobs, apply, track applications
Recruiters Dashboard (/dashboard-recruiter)
Post jobs, view applicants

JOB SEEKER -> JOB APPLICATION 

1. Enhance the AppliedJobsPage.js:

Display detailed job information
Show application status
Add ability to view/download submitted documents


2. Implement the recruiter view of applications:

Create a page for recruiters to view applications
Allow recruiters to download CVs and cover letters
Add functionality to accept/reject applications


3. Add security measures:

Validate file types and sizes
Implement secure file storage
Add CSRF protection


RECRUITER -> JOB POSTINGS & JOB SEEKER DETAILS 

Next Steps:

1. Test the new components - Try logging in as a recruiter and accessing these pages to ensure they work correctly.

2. Implement Edit Job Functionality - To complete the recruiter workflow, you could add an edit job page that allows recruiters to update existing job listings.

3. Add Applicant Filtering - For jobs with many applicants, you might want to add filtering options in the ViewApplicants page.

4. Improve Error Handling - Ensure all API calls have robust error handling to provide informative messages to users.

5. Add Pagination - For scaling, consider adding pagination to the job lists and applicant lists.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have any specific questions about the implementation!RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sorry for asking again, Now i have uploaded my all updated files in Project knowledge. can you again check these finalized code files align with my codes if need any modifications.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Truncating Your Jobs Table Before Import

TRUNCATE TABLE jobs RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

The RESTART IDENTITY part is important as it resets the auto-increment sequence for the job_id column back to 1.

2.Add Sequential IDs to your CSV

SELECT setval('jobs_job_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(job_id) FROM jobs), true);

This will ensure future inserts continue from the highest ID.
