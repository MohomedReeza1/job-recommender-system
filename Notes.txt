I want you to act as a software developer. I will provide some specific information about a web app requirements, and it will be your job to come up with an architecture for developing an job recommendation app integrated with a machine learning. the goal of the app is users to get recommendation on jobs that suits them. the features of the app will include viewing all jobs from a database, get recommendations for suitable jobs according to his/her input data, apply for the job, view applied jobs! 
I need to use React, PostgreSQL and FastAPI as the tools and I'm using VS code. Also I need to train the ML model in google collab.


I need to develop a web app for below requirements,
1. I need to train a high accuracy machine learning model from an excel file which contains some user details and job details that recommends job vacancies posted by agencies when a customer enters his/her personal data.

2. A customer should be able to fill in the personal data in the UI(like in a form) then below their should be a button named "Get job recommendations" and when the customer fills in data and clicked this button, all the relevant job vacancies should be listed (from the job posts that are trained in the ML model).

3. Additionally their should be a "view all jobs" button, and when clicked this button i need to show the all jobs from the postgreSQL database that consist all the job posts.


(My supervisor said to use FastAPI as it will be good)

I need proper beginner level guidance with the code for all the steps (Set up the Environment, Build the FastAPI Backend, Build the Frontend).



(Name,Age,Gender,Height,Weight,Marital Status,Number of Children,Education,Skills,Interests,Previous Jobs,Looking Jobs,Description,Passport Status). 

Job ID, Job Title, Country, Job Description, Skills Required, Experience Required, Age Required, Salary, Working Hour, Facilities, Looking gender, No. of job seekers required,Available Quantity



git remote add origin https://github.com/MohomedReeza1/JobRecommendationSystem.git

https://github.com/MohomedReeza1/JobRecommendationSystem



now i need to Save the model, Test the model on test data,




Step 1: Setting Up Your Data
1. Structure Your Data
2. Clean Your Data
3. Data Splitting

Step 2: Training the Model
1. Define Inputs and Outputs
2. Configure Model Settings
3. Train the Model

Step 3: Testing and Evaluating the Model
1. Apply the Model to Testing Data
2. Evaluate Accuracy

Step 4: Making Predictions with New Data
1. Enter New Data
2. Generate Predictions

are these the steps of creating a machine learning model

APPLY JOBS - QUESTIONS

I need to show the apply_job page so that if a user clicks "apply now" from "Jobs" page, i need to have a form to enter user details in the applying page (Name,Age,Gender,Height,Weight,Marital Status,Number of Children,Education,Skills,Interests,Previous Jobs,Looking Jobs,Description,Passport Status) and click confirm apply. (I need to save this user data into the database as well)

And if a user clicks "apply now" from the recommended jobs "Recommendation" page (after getting recommendations), no need to have a form to enter user details again (as the user already entered the details in the form and got recommendations), just click confirm apply.

A user can apply for one or more jobs as he/she browse through my web-app. And i need to store these applied jobs in the database (applied_jobs table) and show all these applied jobs in the "/applied-jobs" page for the user.

Are there any issues related to this requirement (do we need to implement a session for this? or do we need to implement signup/login or login as a guest or anything like this) or we can implement this requirement?

✅ Job Applied (Specify distribution): Applied job means it is the most successful or most suitable job for a person
✅ Job Clicked/View (Specify frequency): A person can view or click multiple jobs from his/her preference base on his/her skills/interests.
✅ Job Saved/Shortlisted (Specify percentage): No need for Saved/Shortlisted jobs.
✅ Job Ignored (Specify percentage): This is possible. Not every person looking for every job. A person is mostly looking for the relevant jobs based on his/her skills/interests.
Interaction Value Ranges: Application rate: 5%, Click rate: 15%, View rate: 30%, , ignore rate: 50%)

5. Special Considerations
Do you need additional features (e.g., language skills, agency preferences)? No
Do you want some missing/incomplete data for realism? (e.g., 5% missing values) Yes
Do you need data biases to reflect real-world trends? (e.g., certain jobs preferred by males/females) Yes, Also analyze that some jobs are mostly for females (like House Maid, House Nurse, Nurse, Baby Sitter). and some jobs are mostly for males (like Driver,House Driver, House Boy, Warehouse Asssistants, Supervisor, Head Waiter). And also there are some jobs that are required both males and females (like Waiter, Housekeeper, Cleaner, Worker, House Keeper). Therefore distribution these suitably.


For your reference to take an idea from a real dataset that consisting these 109 job titles -> what gender each job title have,which country this job is mostly having and which jobs have the most demands i will attach an excel file.

Please carefully create me this dataset with the information provided and using the job_list excel that contains a real dataset of jobs.


I need the carefully prepared output in one excel file with three sheets.


user_data – 300–500 users with diverse profiles.
job_data – 100+ job listings enriched with relevant skills, descriptions, and required qualifications.
interaction_data – 2,000–5,000 interactions (views, clicks, applications, and ignores) following your specified distribution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Skills Relevance:

Should the skills for each job be researched based on industry standards, or do you have a specific reference or job descriptions you’d like me to use? I don't have any references for job descriptions or skills. researched based on industry standard will be best.
Should the skills be formatted as a comma-separated string? yes.

2. Salary Currency & Conversion:

You mentioned salaries in "Rs." – should this be in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) or another currency? yes, this is in Sri Lankan Rupees.
If using Sri Lankan Rupees, should I convert from the typical salaries paid in these countries? No need, Just use random salary distribution between 150000 to 300000.

3. Age & Experience Distribution:

Should I use a uniform random distribution for age and experience, or do you want some jobs (e.g., skilled roles) to lean towards experienced workers while others (e.g., helpers) allow first-time applicants? skilled roles to lean towards experienced workers while others allow first-time applicants will be better.

4. Gender Distribution:

I will follow the gender preferences you outlined, but should I ensure a strict adherence (e.g., no male Housemaids) or allow minor variance? yes jobs like House Maid, House Nurse, Baby Sitter are only for females and hard jobs like House Boy, Technicians, Machine Operators, Industrial jobs are only for males. Jobs like Waiter, Housekeeper, Cleaner, Worker, House Keeper, general helper are common for both male and females. Therefore distribution these suitably.

5. Country & Job Frequency:

Should high-frequency countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Dubai, Romania) have more jobs than others, or should each country have an equal number? yes, these countries have more jobs.

6. Dataset Format:

Do you need this in Excel (.xlsx) format, CSV (.csv), or both?
Do you require a SQL script to insert this data into a database?

for now i need .xlsx format in order to train the ML model, later i need this to import into PostgreSQL

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want you to conduct industry-specific research for these job titles and insert suitable job related skills

Job Seeker Dataset creation

I need you to create a dataset about 700–900 users with diverse profiles enriched with relevant Skills(critical), Interests(critical), Previous Jobs(critical), Looking Jobs(critical) and Description(critical) for the following columns. 

User ID, Name, Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Marital Status, Number of Children, Education, Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs, Description, Passport Status

1. User ID - This should contain primary numbers starting from 1.

2. Name - Sri Lankan names (example: Nimal Jayawardena-Male, Manisha Gamage-female)

4. Gender - distribute Male and female accordingly (60% Male, 40% Female)

5. Height - Just random heights

6. Weight - Just random weights

7. Marital Status - consider the age and distribute between single or married accordingly.

13. Looking Jobs - empty for now

14. Description - empty for now

15. Passport Status - 70% Valid, 20% Applied, 10% Invalid


Special Considerations
Do you want some missing/incomplete data for realism? (e.g., 5% missing values) Yes

Do you need data biases to reflect real-world trends? (e.g., certain jobs preferred by males/females) Yes

To ensure the format is okay i want you to only create 30 rows of data. If everythings okay we will continue to generate Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs, Description columns.

example row:
1
Priya Fernando
29
Female
160 cm
55 kg

user_data – 700–900 users with diverse profiles.
job_data – 200 job listings enriched with relevant skills, descriptions, and required qualifications.
interaction_data – 5,000–10,000 interactions (views, clicks, applications, and ignores) following your specified distribution.

Template description-

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//So for these critical columns i will provide some data in order to help you generating these data. 

Find the updated job_list-interest-skills.xlsx file.
job_seeker_sample_unique.xlsx this is the file you need to fill in Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs columns.

job_list-interest-skills.xlsx this file contains a 100 different job titles, skills related to each job titles and interests related to each job titles and also a dataset of 200 different job posts with job details such as Job Description, Skills Required, Experience Required, Looking gender. This will make you life easier to generate for like 700-900 data.

10. Skills - So skills must contain minimum of 2 skills related to either a user's Previous Job or Looking Job or both Previous Job and Looking Job.

11. Interests - Interests must contain minimum of 2 interests related to either a user's Previous Job or Looking Job or both Previous Job and Looking Job.

12. Previous Jobs - A user may or may not have a previous job. A user may have a multiple previous jobs. If this column has a job title, then skills and interests related to this job should be updated in the skills column and interests column.

13. Looking Jobs - A user may or may not have a looking Job. A user may have a multiple looking jobs. If this column has a job title, then skills and interests related to this job should be updated in the skills column and interests column.

14. Description - empty for now

Special conditions - 
1. A Looking Job should be based on the previous job. That means a user having experience on some job will looking for the same job. A user can have both multiple previous jobs and looking jobs. Also a user may not have both a previous job or a looking job (In this case, still a user can have interests and skills)
2. The gender of the user should be dependent with the jobs that they are eligible. "job_list" sheet of job_list-interest-skills.xlsx contains the looking gender for every job posts (male or female or male, female both).
3. If two jobs in the same job category have common Skills & interests, then previous jobs or/and looking jobs can contain those two jobs (for example, "Health Assessment" skill is common for both Nurse and House Nurse, so where the skill is Health Assessment their previous jobs or/and looking jobs can be Nurse or House Nurse). But an unrelated jobs cannot contain be together.
4. It is okay to have unmatching looking jobs for a very few data. But later in a "interaction dataset" we need to show that we ignored (or didn't show interest) these jobs.

Your concerns - 
1. Skills & Interests
Should Skills be occupation-related (e.g., "Carpentry, Plumbing") or include general skills (e.g., "Teamwork, Problem-solving")? I have given a list of skills and interests for each job title.

Should Interests be more personal (e.g., "Sports, Traveling") or career-related (e.g., "Learning new machinery, Customer service")? I have given a list of skills and interests for each job title. Use those skills and interests.

2. Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs
Should Previous Jobs be more aligned with Looking Jobs or do we allow career shifts?Previous Jobs be more aligned with Looking Jobs will be more promising for creating a high accuracy ML model.

Should we mix low-skilled, semi-skilled, and skilled jobs for variety? (e.g., waiter, driver, electrician, security guard) No

Should we assign realistic job transitions (e.g., "Helper → House Boy → Driver") or keep them randomized? Yes. realistic job transitions will be promising for better results. Domestic jobs like House Cook, House Boy, House Driver, House Maid, House Nurse are also likely related. But watch out for gender restriction. 

3. Description
Should this be a short bio (e.g., "Experienced waiter looking for opportunities in a hotel.") or a detailed profile (e.g., "Worked as a waiter for 3 years, skilled in customer service and table management. Looking for jobs in hotels or restaurants.")? Keep this empty for now.

Should we add some missing or incomplete descriptions for realism? yes total 1% from the whole dataset.

Carefully generate me these columns for the generated 30 data for now according to these requirements, if this becomes successful we can move on the filling the Description.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Gender Restrictions

If a Male user has a Looking Job that is gender-restricted to Female (and vice versa), should I:
Exclude such cases entirely? 
Adjust the Looking Job based on the allowed gender from the dataset?

you are the one who is generating the Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs columns. So for a male user only include an allowed job from the job dataset. or Adjust the Looking Job based on the allowed gender from the dataset.


2. Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs Distribution

What should be the approximate distribution for:
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs?
Users with only Previous Jobs?
Users with only Looking Jobs?
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests)?

This has many possibilities such as, 
1. Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs - 
- this can contain 1 Previous Jobs, 2 Looking Jobs 
- this can contain 2 Previous Jobs, 1 Looking Jobs 
- this can contain 2 Previous Jobs, 2 Looking Jobs or many other different way right.
2. Users with only Previous Jobs?
- this can contain 1 Previous Jobs
- this can contain 2 Previous Jobs
3. Users with only Looking Jobs?
- this can contain 1 Looking Jobs
- this can contain 2 Looking Jobs
So basically this have to be in a random order and basically i can say is (including above patterns),
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs? 30% (looking jobs need to be more connected with previous job)
Users with only Previous Jobs? 19%
Users with only Looking Jobs? 20%
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests)? 1%
Users with a Looking Job same as Previous Job? 30%

before proceeding, if you have further questions do ask me

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above generated excel 5 of the data is wrong which is male job seekers have female job details (Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs). And below some requirements are changed. According to these i need to modify job_seeker_sample_unique.xlsx the Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs columns properly.

Find the updated job_list-interest-skills.xlsx file.
job_seeker_sample_unique.xlsx this is the file you need to fill in Skills, Interests, Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs columns.

12. Previous Jobs - A user may or may not have a previous job. A user may have a multiple previous jobs. If this column has a job title, then skills and interests related to this job should be updated in the skills column and interests column.

13. Looking Jobs - A user may or may not have a looking Job. A user may have a multiple looking jobs. If this column has a job title, then skills and interests related to this job should be updated in the skills column and interests column.

5. Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs Distribution

What should be the approximate distribution for:
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs?
Users with only Previous Jobs?
Users with only Looking Jobs?
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests)?

This has many possibilities such as,

2. Users with only Previous Jobs?
- this can contain 1 Previous Jobs
- this can contain 2 Previous Jobs
3. Users with only Looking Jobs?
- this can contain 1 Looking Jobs
- this can contain 2 Looking Jobs
So basically this have to be in a random order and basically i can say is (including above patterns),
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs? 15% (looking jobs need to be more connected with previous job)
Users with only Previous Jobs? 15%
Users with only Looking Jobs? 15%
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests)? 1%
Users with a Looking Job same as Previous Job? 53%
Users with unmatching previous job and looking jobs? 1%

Carefully generate me these columns for the generated 30 data for now according to these requirements, if this becomes successful we can move on the filling the Description.

before proceeding, if you have further questions do ask me

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Gender Dependency on Looking Jobs:

If a job has a gender restriction (e.g., "House Maid" is for females), should I exclude it entirely for a male seeker or replace it with a similar, gender-appropriate job (e.g., "House Boy")? You exclude it entirely for a male seeker and replace with a suitable female job seeker.

2. Mixing of Previous and Looking Jobs:

Should I strictly follow job category links (e.g., "Helper → House Boy → House Driver")? No
Or should I allow slight career shifts within related fields (e.g., "Construction Helper → Mason")? It's fine.

3. Interest & Skills Mapping:

Should I allow some overlap in skills and interests (e.g., "House Driver" and "Driver" share "Vehicle Maintenance")? Yes, its fine
Or should each record have distinct, non-overlapping entries? No

4. Skills Randomization:

Should I shuffle the order of skills & interests for variety? Yeah, i think it is okay
Or keep them consistent based on job roles?

5. Distribution Verification:

Does this final distribution align with your needs?
Users with both Previous Jobs & Looking Jobs: 30%
Users with only Previous Jobs: 19%
Users with only Looking Jobs: 20%
Users with neither (but still have skills & interests): 1%
Users with a Looking Job same as Previous Job: 30%

Yes.

before proceeding, if you have further questions do ask me


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

male job seekers should not have jobs that are gender-restricted to females (and vice versa).

In this result Flower Decorator (Flower Shops), Waitress jobs are for females but two males seekers contain these jobs. What it is happening like that? Is this a mistake from you?
I cannot generate 700-900 data like this. Because the accuracy will reduce.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-For 1 previous job
Worked as a [Previous Jobs] for [between 1-5] years, skilled in [skill1] and [skill2]. Looking for jobs in hotels or restaurants.


Worked as a waiter for 3 years, skilled in customer service and table management. Looking for jobs in hotels or restaurants.

Worked as a House Driver, Commis Chef, skilled in Vehicle Maintenance, Private Transport and have a keen interest in Vehicle Maintenance, Cooking Assistance. Currently, looking for opportunities as House Driver, Commis Chef.

Lalith Bandara has experience working as House Driver, Commis Chef. They are skilled in Vehicle Maintenance, Private Transport. They have a keen interest in Vehicle Maintenance, Cooking Assistance. Currently, they are looking for opportunities as House Driver, Commis Chef.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Total Expected Row Count:
Should we aim for 700-900 additional rows on top of the 90 rows already generated? Yes
Or should the final dataset total be between 700-900 rows including existing 90?

2. Name Generation Strategy:
Since we don’t have 700+ unique Sri Lankan names, I'll use a large set of common Sri Lankan names and randomly shuffle & reuse them across different records.
Do you want a higher mix of male vs female names (e.g., 60% male, 40% female) or should I make it an even distribution? use higher mix of male vs female names.

3. Job Assignment Logic:
Right now, I am following the probability-based job assignment:
15% have both previous and looking jobs
15% have only previous jobs
15% have only looking jobs
1% have neither, but still have skills & interests
54% have looking jobs same as previous jobs
Should this distribution remain the same or do you want a different pattern for the larger dataset?

if u can use the following values,
25% have both previous and looking jobs
15% have only previous jobs
15% have only looking jobs
1% have neither, but still have skills & interests
44% have looking jobs same as previous jobs

4. Education and Passport Distribution:
The education and passport status distribution currently follows real-world probability (e.g., majority with O/L, A/L education, and 70% with valid passports). Do you want any adjustments to this distribution? No this is fine.

5. Output Format:
Would you like the final dataset split into multiple smaller files (e.g., 2-3 files for easier handling), or one single large file containing 700-900 rows? Anything is fine, i need in an excel format.


before proceeding, if you have further questions do ask me

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERACTION DATASET CREATION

How should I handle missing Previous Jobs and Looking Jobs? 
Should I assume these users explore various jobs randomly?

Well, These are the percentage of dataset contains in the combination of skills, interests and Previous Jobs, Looking Jobs in user_data.
25% have both previous and looking jobs
15% have only previous jobs
15% have only looking jobs
1% have neither, but still have skills & interests (can view, click, apply based on the skills & interests)
44% have looking jobs same as previous jobs

So for each job title there are 2 jobs in the job_data. I want you include all jobs that are related for a user in the interaction data (related in the sense can include in skills and/or interests and/or Previous Jobs and/or Looking Jobs). 

From all jobs that the users are including,
1. view must include the least related job or jobs for the user (user is viewing the job)
2. click must include the medium/average related job or jobs for the user (user is clicking the job)
3. apply must include the most related / most suitable job or jobs for the user (user is applying for the job)

With 900+ users with diverse profiles (user_data) and 200 job listings enriched with relevant skills, descriptions, and required qualifications (job_data) approximately how many interaction_data needed for the Hybrid Recommender System? and approximately how many interaction_data you can create?

interaction_data – 5,000–10,000 interactions (views, clicks, applications) following your specified distribution.

11. Handling Cold Start Problem – Provide recommendations for new users/jobs


🔹 Handling Cold Start Problem: Provide Recommendations for New Users/Jobs
The cold start problem occurs when:

1. New users join the platform without prior interactions.
2. New jobs are added that haven't received any applications.
We need a fallback recommendation strategy for both cases.

🔹 Solution: Cold Start Handling
We will use two fallback approaches:

1. For New Users:
• Recommend popular jobs (jobs with the most applications).
• Recommend jobs matching the user’s skills & interests.

2. For New Jobs:
• Recommend new jobs to users who match the job's required skills.

✅ Step 1: Get Most Popular Jobs
We determine job popularity based on the number of interactions.

def get_popular_jobs(interaction_data, top_n=5):
    """Returns the most popular jobs based on the number of applications."""
    job_popularity = interaction_data['Job ID'].value_counts().head(top_n).index.tolist()
    return job_popularity


✅ Step 2: Recommend Jobs Based on User Profile
For a new user, we check their skills & interests and recommend jobs accordingly.

def recommend_jobs_for_new_user(user_profile, job_data, top_n=5):
    """Recommends jobs based on a new user's skills & interests using TF-IDF similarity."""
    user_vector = tfidf.transform([user_profile])
    job_vectors = tfidf.transform(job_data['Details'])

    # Compute similarity
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(user_vector, job_vectors).flatten()

    # Get top-N job indices
    top_jobs_indices = similarity_scores.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
    recommended_jobs = job_data.iloc[top_jobs_indices]['Job ID'].tolist()

    return recommended_jobs

✅ Step 3: Recommend New Jobs to Matching Users
If a job is new, find users who have similar skills to the job's required skills.

def recommend_new_jobs_to_users(new_jobs, user_data, job_data, top_n=5):
    """Finds the best users for newly added jobs based on skills match."""
    recommendations = {}

    for _, job in new_jobs.iterrows():
        job_vector = tfidf.transform([job['Details']])
        user_vectors = tfidf.transform(user_data['Profile'])

        # Compute similarity between job and users
        similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(job_vector, user_vectors).flatten()

        # Get top-N user indices
        top_users_indices = similarity_scores.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
        recommended_users = user_data.iloc[top_users_indices]['User ID'].tolist()

        recommendations[job['Job ID']] = recommended_users

    return recommendations

✅ Step 4: Integrate Cold Start Recommendations
We check if a user is new or if a job is new, and apply the appropriate fallback.

def get_cold_start_recommendations(user_id, user_data, job_data, interaction_data):
    """Handles cold start by providing fallback recommendations for new users or jobs."""
    
    # If the user is new (no prior interactions)
    if user_id not in interaction_data['User ID'].unique():
        print(f"User {user_id} is new. Providing cold-start recommendations.")
        user_profile = user_data[user_data['User ID'] == user_id]['Profile'].values[0]
        
        # Recommend jobs based on user profile
        return recommend_jobs_for_new_user(user_profile, job_data)
    
    return None  # No cold start needed for existing users

✅ Step 5: Handle Cold Start for Jobs
If new jobs exist, assign them to users who match their skillset.

def get_cold_start_jobs(job_data, interaction_data):
    """Finds jobs that have not received any applications (cold start jobs)."""
    new_jobs = job_data[~job_data['Job ID'].isin(interaction_data['Job ID'].unique())]
    if not new_jobs.empty:
        print("New jobs detected. Finding best users for them.")
        return recommend_new_jobs_to_users(new_jobs, user_data, job_data)
    
    return None  # No cold start jobs found


🔹 Final Step: Apply Cold Start Strategy
Integrate these functions when generating recommendations.

# Example Usage:

user_id = 999  # Example new user ID
cold_start_recommendations = get_cold_start_recommendations(user_id, user_data, job_data, interaction_data)

if cold_start_recommendations:
    print(f"Cold Start Recommendations for User {user_id}: {cold_start_recommendations}")
else:
    print(f"User {user_id} has interactions, using normal recommendation system.")

cold_start_jobs = get_cold_start_jobs(job_data, interaction_data)

if cold_start_jobs:
    print("Cold Start Job Assignments:", cold_start_jobs)


🔹 Summary
✅ Cold Start for New Users:

If a user has no prior interactions, recommend popular jobs or jobs matching their profile.
✅ Cold Start for New Jobs:

If a job has no applications, recommend it to users with matching skills.
